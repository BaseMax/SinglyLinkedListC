# Singly Linked-List C

This is a simple implementation of a singly linked-list in C. Singly linked-lists are a type of data structure that are used to store a collection of elements. Each element in a singly linked-list is called a node. Each node contains two parts: the data and a pointer to the next node. The first node in a singly linked-list is called the head. The last node in a singly linked-list is called the tail. The tail node points to NULL. The head node is the only node that can be accessed from outside the linked-list. The head node is used to traverse the linked-list. The head node is also used to add and remove nodes from the linked-list.
